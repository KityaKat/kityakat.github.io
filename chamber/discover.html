        <h2>Welcome to Cy-Fair</h2>
        <p>
          Cypress Fairbanks, or more fondly known as Cy-Fair, is one of the
          largest communities in Northwest Houston. Cy-Fair encompasses 186
          square miles and includes Katy, Cypress, and the city of Jersey
          Village. This expansive area is located along U.S. Highway 290
          (Northwest Freeway) twenty miles (32 km) northwest of Downtown
          Houston. Two major freeways are found in the Cy-Fair area – U.S. 290
          and State Highway 249, serving as the area’s major links with Houston.
          The Sam Houston Tollway serves as a major connection to areas located
          both east and south of Cy-Fair.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are very proud of our thriving community nestled in the Northwest
          quadrant of Houston. Since 2000, the population has increased over 50%
          to nearly three-quarters of a million people. To put that in
          perspective, if the Cy-Fair area were a city, it would be in the top
          20 largest cities in the United States. It is not hard to figure out
          why so many businesses and families have chosen to call Cy-Fair home.
          This is a prosperous community that provides an outstanding quality of
          life. You will find exactly what you are looking for within our
          boundaries and you can find every service and product you need in our
          directory of members.
