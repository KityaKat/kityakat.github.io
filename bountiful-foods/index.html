          <h2>We Care Because We Live Here</h2>
          <p>
            The California South Coast region extends from Ventura County to the
            Mexican Border and includes the counties of Los Angeles, Orange and
            San Diego. It is known for its sandy beaches, surf-able waves,
            moderate climate, and large and diverse population. The beaches of
            the south coast are world famous recreational destinations that
            attract millions of visitors annually and are a major contributor to
            both the economy and the quality of life in the region. Southern
            California beaches typically receive over a million visitors each
            year. To us here at Bountiful Foods, the region is our home. That's
            why we've partnered with
            <a href="https://scc.ca.gov/"
              >The Coastal Conservancy of California</a
            >
            to give back to the places that shaped us. Ten percent of all
            proceeds go to support the conservancy's work.

          <center><h2>Some Places We Love</h2></center>
          <h3>South Ponto State Beach, Carlsbad, CA</h3>
          <center>
            <img
              src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KityaKat/kityakat.github.io/master/bountiful-foods/images/South-Ponto-Beach.jpg"
            />
          </center>
          <p>
            South Ponto Beach is a rare gem in that it is one of the widest
            beaches in the county and exists in an undeveloped area. Coast Hwy
            101 hugs the shoreline here, with Batiquitos Lagoon on the other
            side of the highway. The beach is a popular family destination, and
            only one of the few beaches in the area that has public restrooms
            and showers. If you happen to be driving on Coast Hwy 101 by this
            beach during sunset, you might find it irresistible to park on the
            highway shoulder and walk onto the sand to enjoy the captivating
            colors, wide stretch of sand, and water pounding on the jetty.
          </p>
          <h3>Oceanside Harbor Beach, Oceanside, CA</h3>
          <center>
            <img
              src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KityaKat/kityakat.github.io/master/bountiful-foods/images/Oceanside-Beach.jpg"
            />
          </center>
          <p>
            Bounded by the Oceanside Harbor and Cape Cod style Village on one
            side, and the Camp Pendleton Marine base on the other, this long,
            sandy beach is a perfect place to get away. Oceanside Harbor Beach
            is a wide sandy beach in front of Oceanside’s harbor. The beach is
            boxed in by two rock jetties at the ends which seems to hold in the
            large amounts of sand here. It’s a popular beach for sunbathing.
            Oceanside Pier is in the distance to the south and the Oceanside
            Marina is visible right behind the beach The sidewalks behind the
            beach and around the harbor offer miles of walking opportunities.
            The harbor has shops and restaurants if you plan to spend the entire
            day at the beach. You’ll also find volleyball courts, picnic areas,
            barbeques for grilling, and other beach amenities.
          </p>
          <h3>T-Street Beach, San Clemente, CA</h3>
          <center>
            <img
              src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KityaKat/kityakat.github.io/master/bountiful-foods/images/Tstreet-Beach.jpg"
            />
          </center>
          <p>
            One of the best surfing spots in Orange County, T-Street is the
            quintessential "Endless Summer" California beach hangout offering
            everything you need to enjoy a day in the sun. T Street Beach is
            found at the west end of Esplanade Street in San Clemente and that
            is why it is sometimes referred to as Esplanade Beach. T-Street is
            part of the San Clemente City Beach system. It has a safe pedestrian
            overpass over the railroad tracks from the parking areas at the “T”
            intersection of Esplanade and Paseo De Cristobal. The city maintains
            facilities at this palm tree-lined beach and provides lifeguards
            when it’s busy. The San Clemente Pier is just north and frequently
            photographed from this spot. The San Clemente Coastal Trail passes
            by here making it easy to walk to the pier or south to other
            beaches.

          <h3>Main Beach Park, Laguna Beach, CA</h3>
          <center>
            <img
              src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KityaKat/kityakat.github.io/master/bountiful-foods/images/Laguna-Beach-Ca-main-beach.jpg"
            />
          </center>
          <p>
            Main Beach is the largest and most popular stretch of beach in
            Laguna. It is located in the middle of the town where Broadway and
            Ocean Avenues intersect Coast Highway. Among all the stretches of
            sand in Laguna Beach, none is more iconic, more recognizable, or
            more accessible to the masses than Main Beach. This is one of
            America’s truly “must visit” beaches. It’s bucket list worthy -- a
            place you really ought to experience for yourself. This is one of
            the most well-known beaches on the planet. Unless you’re extremely
            crowd averse, you should definitely see it at least once. Since it
            is in the middle of the town, it is a short walk from the beach to
            the numerous restaurant and shopping areas that are downtown.

          <h3>Venice Beach, Los Angeles, CA</h3>
          <center>
            <img
              src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KityaKat/kityakat.github.io/master/bountiful-foods/images/Venice-Beach.jpg"
            />
          </center>
          <p>
            Venice Beach, which receives millions of visitors a year, has been
            labeled as "a cultural hub known for its eccentricities" as well as
            a "global tourist destination". The central hub of Venice Beach is
            at an area known as Muscle Beach, a nickname earned for the outdoor
            workout facilities and muscle display platform. Abutting Santa
            Monica’s south side on the Pacific Coast Highway, Venice Beach—or
            simply Venice—was developed as a Los Angeles beach resort that paid
            homage to its Italian namesake with canals, piazzas, pedestrian
            bridges, a lagoon, and a colonnaded business district. Designed by
            eccentric millionaire Abbot Kinney in 1905, Venice’s original
            waterways and charming beach cottages can still be seen on Dell
            Avenue in the Venice Canal Historic District.

          <h3>South Beach, Del Mar, CA</h3>
          <center>
            <img
              src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KityaKat/kityakat.github.io/master/bountiful-foods/images/South-Beach-Del-Mar.jpg"
            />
          </center>
          <p>
            Though it can be a bit confusing to differentiate between the Del
            Mar beaches, they are easy to find and walk between each one. South
            Beach is defined as south of Powerhouse Park all the way down to 6th
            Street at the southern end of Torrey Pines State Beach. This section
            is less popular for swimming and surfing than the neighboring
            Northern portion, but the high, jagged cliffs above it make for a
            beautiful and scenic beach walk.
